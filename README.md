# oops-laravel-code-review 

### Looking for a better way to assess real PHP framework skills?

### Tired of FizzBuzz, bubble sort, or palindrome challenges in code job interviews?

This repository contains a deliberately flawed (but functional) PHP project, with issues in both design and security.
It aims to challenge a developer's skills in a PHP laravel environnement. A job interview would be an appropriate usecase.

Instead of solving artificial algorithm puzzles, candidates can review, critique, and suggest improvements to this codebase.

This approach provides a much clearer picture of a developerâ€™s understanding of modern PHP practices and frameworks.
Because the exercise is open ended, you can evaluate their expertise, gain insights into their reasoning process and even learn something from their feedback.

# Installation

Because this repository is based on 'laravel-starter', please refer to the original documentation : https://github.com/nasirkhan/laravel-starter

**Be sure to execute the migrations first and demo data seeding command before use.**

Remove the markdown/FLAWS.md wich contains the possible solutions.

# Use

It should take about 10 to 20 minutes to complete the code review.

The design flaws are located through the **Post Module ** Modules/Post/* (so that the interviewed person doesn't have to search the whole project).

Basic user credentials :

```
User: super@admin.com
